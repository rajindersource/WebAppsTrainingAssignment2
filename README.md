Created a HTML page showing a list of users in a tabular
format. The data is populated from a JSON
stored in code. The page opens with
just a button saying 'Load data'. Clicking on that button
shows the data in tabular form. After that, the button changes to 'Refresh data'. The columns needed in UI are
- First name, Middle name, Last name, email, phone
number, role, address. Last column has 2
buttons saying 'Edit' and 'Delete'. Clicking on Edit
makes the row editable, with Save and Cancel button shown at
last column. Save click keeps the changes in UI.
Cancel reverts it back. Delete just removes
the row from UI. Refresh data reloads the data
again. I have used the concepts read so far.

1.Json data is imported into a HTML Table using jquery/javascript.
2.HTML table is defined in myindex.html
3.Styling of the Table and HTML is in mystyles.css
4.Javascript to populate data from Json to HTML is in myscript.js
5.The JSON data to be populated is in mydata.json
6.To use fetch cmd in jquery, a google api for the library is loaded in HTML.
7.In case of CORS plocy error, Open with Live server in Visual studio code.
